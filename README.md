### Codes following the data analysis order presented in the paper, including:

This is needs some work to clean the code and put things in a logical ways! - Weixuan is on it   üòù

####  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Pop gene analysis (PCA, NJ-tree, Structure)
1. All AD1 65 samples' raw reads were trimmed with [Trimmomatic](https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic.git).

2. Following [sentieon-dnaseq](https://github.com/Sentieon/sentieon-dnaseq.git), trimmmed reads were mapped to the reference genome; then GVCF calling; VCF calling. 
  
3. SNPs filtering via [vcftools](https://vcftools.sourceforge.net/man_latest.html) and [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html). 

4. Using biallelic SNPs to estimate population genetic groups via [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) (PCA) and [LEA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/LEA.html).
   
5. Building a rooted NJ-tree via PLINK & [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html) using bialleic SNPs by including additional two AD4 outgroups. 

####  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Genetic variation comparison (Pi, Dxy, Fst, He, Fis, LD)
1. [Pixy](https://github.com/ksamuk/pixy.git) was applied to calculate Pi, Dxy and Fst between four groups and MK cotton.

2. Vcftools was applied to cacluate He, Fis

3. [PopLDdecay](https://github.com/BGI-shenzhen/PopLDdecay) was applied to estimate LD decay between all five groups.


####  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Novel SNPs tabulating
1. Bcftools and *awk* was applied to tabulate the novel SNPs.

####  ‚ñ™Ô∏è MK cotton population demographic analysis (PCA, Tajima's D, SFS, Ne)
1. [Angsd](https://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Thetas,Tajima,Neutrality_tests)
2. [SMC++](https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp)
